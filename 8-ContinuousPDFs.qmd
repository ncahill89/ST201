## Continuous Random Variables {style="font-size: 65%;"}

A **continuous random variable** is a variable that can take any real value within an interval, meaning it can assume an infinite number of possible values across the specified range. Common intervals include:

-   **Whole real line:** $(- \infty, \infty)$
-   **Positive real line:** $(0, \infty)$
-   **Finite intervals:** $(5, 25)$, $(a, b)$, etc.

#### Key Characteristics

-   Values are not countable—there’s an infinite number of possible outcomes.

-   Typically modeled with a probability density function (PDF).

**Examples:**

-   Amount of rainfall in a day (measured in mm)

-   Distance covered in a training session (km)

-   Weight of a book (grams)

## Properties of Continuous Probability Distributions {style="font-size: 55%;"}

-   The outcomes are measured, not counted.

-   The graph of a continuous probability distribution is a curve. Probability is represented by area under the curve.

-   The curve is called the probability density function (abbreviated as pdf). We use the symbol f(x) to represent the curve.

-   Area under the curve is given by a function called the cumulative distribution function (abbreviated as cdf). The cumulative distribution function, F(x), is used to evaluate probability as area.

-   In technical terms

$$F(x) = P(X \le x) = \displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{x} f(u) du$$.


**The expected value** of a continuous random variable is defined as

$$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{-\infty}xf(x) dx$$ 

**The variance** of a discrete random variable is defined as

$$Var[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$$



## Properties of Continuous Probability Distributions {style="font-size: 65%;"}


-   The entire area under the curve and above the x-axis is equal to one. In technical terms

$$\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1$$.


-   Probability is found for intervals of x values rather than for individual x values.

-   $P(c < x < d)$ is the probability that the random variable X is in the interval between the values c and d. This equates to the area under the curve, above the x-axis, to the right of c and the left of d.

-   $P(x = c) = 0$. The probability that x takes on any single individual value is zero.

## Types of continuous distributions {style="font-size: 65%;"}

We will look at 3 types of continuous distributions. These are the:

-   Uniform distribution

-   Exponential distribution

-   Normal distribution

For continuous probability distributions, PROBABILITY = AREA.

## The Uniform Distribution {style="font-size: 60%;"}

Suppose I choose a number randomly from \[a,b\].

-   Let $X$ be the resulting number, then $X \sim$ Uniform \[a,b\]

**PDF and CDF**

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(x)  & = & \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
0 & \mbox{ if $x < a$}\\ 
\frac{1}{b-a} & \mbox{ if $a \le x \le b$}\\ 
0 & \mbox{ if $x > b$}  
\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray*}
```
```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F(x) = P(X \leq x)   & = & \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
0 & \mbox{ if $x < a$}\\ 
\frac{x-a}{b-a} & \mbox{ if $a \le x \le b$}\\ 
1 & \mbox{ if $x > b$}  
\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray*}
```

**E\[X\] and Var\[X\] for a uniform random variable:** 

-   $E(X) = \mu = \frac{a+b}{2}$

-   $Var(X) = \sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$

## Example {style="font-size: 70%;"}

The net weight of a packages has a uniform distribution over the interval 980 g to 1030 g.

-   What is the expected weight of a package?

-   What is the probability that a package weighs less than 1000 g?

-   What is the probability that a package weighs between 990 and 1010 g?

-   What is the 75th percentile of this distribution?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
punif(1000, 980, 1030)

punif(1010, 980, 1030) - punif(990, 980, 1030)

qunif(0.75, 980, 1030)
```

## The Exponential Distribution {style="font-size: 65%;"}

The exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.

**Example**

Let $X$ = time between events. On average there are $\lambda$ events per unit of time.


We can model this as $X \sim$ exponential($\lambda$).

**PDF and CDF**

$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \mbox{ with }x \ge 0$$

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F(x) &=& P(X \le x) = \int_{0}^{x}\lambda e^{-\lambda u} du\\
&=& 1 - e^{-\lambda x}
\end{eqnarray*}
```

**E\[X\] and Var\[X\] for an exponential random variable:** 

$E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ \hspace{1em} $Var(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$

## Example {style="font-size: 70%;"}

Let Y be the random variable which counts the “number of accesses per second for a search engine”. Assume that Y is Poisson distributed with parameter $\lambda = 10$ (E\[Y\] = 10, Var\[Y\] = 10). The random variable X, “waiting time until the next access”, is then exponentially distributed with parameter $\lambda = 10$

-   What is the expected waiting time for next access?

-   What is the probability that the waiting time is $\le$ 0.6 seconds?

-   What is the probability that the waiting time is in \[0.05, 0.2\] seconds?

-   What is the 80th percentile of this distribution?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pexp(0.6, rate = 10)

pexp(0.2, rate = 10) - pexp(0.05, rate = 10)

qexp(0.8, 10)
```

## The Normal Distribution {style="font-size: 70%;"}

This continuous distribution is one of the most commonly used distributions in statistics. It is used to model, for example,

-   experimental errors in scientific measurements

-   test scores in aptitude tests

-   heights of people selected at random from a population.

The normal distribution has two parameters (two numerical descriptive measures), the mean ($\mu$) and the standard deviation ($\sigma$). If X is a quantity to be measured that has a normal distribution with mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$), we designate this by writing

$$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$$

## The Normal Distribution {style="font-size: 70%;"}

**PDF**

This is a rather complicated function.

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2} }e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}}$$ with $-\infty < x < \infty$.



**E\[X\] and Var\[X\] for a normal random variable:** 


  - E\[$X$\] = $\mu$ 
  
  - Var($X$) = $\sigma^2$

## Properties of the normal distribution {style="font-size: 70%;"}

-   The shape of the normal pdf is described as bell shaped. It is symmetric about $\mu$ (half of the area under the curve is above and half below $\mu$).

-   Approximately 68% of the area under the curves lies in ($\mu-\sigma$, $\mu+\sigma$).

-   Approximately 95% of the area under the curves lies in ($\mu-2\sigma$, $\mu+2\sigma$).

-   Approximately 99.7% of the area under the curves lies in ($\mu-3\sigma$, $\mu+3\sigma$).

-   This is known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. Graphically it is represented by:

![](images/normal_rule.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example {style="font-size: 70%;"}

An orange farmer sells his oranges in wooden boxes. The weights of the boxes vary and are assumed to be normally distributed with $\mu = 15$ kg and $\sigma^2 =2.25$ kg$^2$.

-   What is the probability that a box with a weight of less than 13 kg is sold?

-   What is the probability that the weight is between 12 and 14 kg?

-   What is the 68th percentile of this distribution?

```{r, echo=TRUE}

pnorm(13, 15, sqrt(2.25))

pnorm(14, 15, sqrt(2.25)) - pnorm(12, 15, sqrt(2.25))

qexp(0.68, 15, sqrt(2.25))

```
