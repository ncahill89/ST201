## Diversity & inclusion {style="font-size: 80%;"}

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. I may not always get this right so please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

To help with this:

-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official University records, please let me know!

-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns if you wish to do so.

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
