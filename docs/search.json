In order to investigate whether the differences in satisfaction is due to natural variability in people’s honesty or due to a treatment effect (i.e., what seat that sat in), we need to compute expected (estimated) counts for each cell in a two-way table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall what proportion gave a poor satisfaction rating?\n\n\nWe see from the marginal distribution that the overall proportion of people that gave a poor satisfaction rating is 0.15 or 15%.\nIf class didn’t matter (i.e, satisfaction is independent of class), 15% of respondents would disclose this satisfaction rating regardless of their seat, so 15% in economy and 15% in business.\nBased on this line of thinking, we can compute an expected count under an independence assumption."
